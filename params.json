{"name":"Gconf","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.gnome.org/gconf","body":"GConf is a configuration database system, functionally similar to the\r\nWindows registry but lots better. :-) It's being written for the GNOME\r\ndesktop but does not require GNOME; configure should notice if GNOME\r\nis not installed and compile the basic GConf library anyway.\r\n\r\nGConf does require glib and ORBit.  It has optional ldap and xml backends\r\nthat require openldap and libxml respectively.\r\n\r\nFor information, see:\r\n http://projects.gnome.org/gconf/\r\n\r\nThere's a mailing list gconf-list@gnome.org, see\r\nhttp://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gconf-list.\r\n\r\nThe GConf maintainer is Havoc Pennington <hp@redhat.com>. Bugs and\r\npatches should be filed in Bugzilla, http://bugzilla.gnome.org,\r\nagainst the GConf product. Send questions and comments to Havoc or to\r\ngconf-list@gnome.org.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
